# More code to follow but I need to go back and do some exercises with lists and tuples.

# LISTS

mylist = []             # This creates a basic empty list. A a type of Python data structure.
mylist.append(1)        # .append() adds a single value to the list.

mylist2 = [1, 2, 3, "text"]
print(mylist2)
