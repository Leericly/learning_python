# learning_python
My own repository for projects in learning Python, Micro Python, and Raspberry Pi

I haven't really dug into how GitHub works and I'm just getting started with Python as well. I'm not sure if I'm using this correctly but I will try to upload the code I've written as a way to catalog my learning journey.
