# learning_python
My own repository for projects in learning Python, Micro Python, and Raspberry Pi

I haven't really dug into how GitHub works and I'm just getting started with Python as well. I'm not sure if I'm using this correctly but I will try to upload the code I've written as a way to catalog my learning journey.

As a disclaimer, some of the code I upload will be snippets I've taken from various learning resources (noted when neccessary) so it's important to know that as a user, you assume all responsibility for using the code and should understand how the code works before implementing. As an example: one bit of code I've uploaded was taken from an online source and allows the user to scan for open ports on a network. The user assumes all responsibility for running this code and it should only be done on systems and networks that belong to the user. Running such programs on a work network or other non-user-owned network may be considered illegal. Please be aware of this when using code found on the internet.
