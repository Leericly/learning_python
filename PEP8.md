This is a condensed version of the Python PEP 0008
I will be adding to this over time to help my Python projects get better

- Indentation & Lines: 
    1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    2. Use Spaces (not tabs).
    3. Limit lines to 79 characters (72 for docstrings and comments).
    4. Break lines BEFORE Binary operations:
        Yes   10 <br>
               + 5 = x 
        No    10 + <br>
               5 = x
    5. Surround top-level functions and class definitions with TWO blank lines.
    6. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by ONE blank line.
    7. Use blank lines to separate groups of related functions.
    8. Use blank lines sparingly elsewhere to indicate logical sections.

- Source File Encoding:
    1.
